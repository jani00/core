<h1>What is Contest Respository?</h1>
<div class="richtext">
	<p>
		The Contest Repository
		is a unified system that manages resources related to computer
		programming contest-like events. Computer programming contests are out
		in the open for quite a while, yet all the different championships
		remain isolated from one another with highly customized systems
		managing their set of resources such as programming tasks
		descriptions, ratings and tests. These systems fail to provide a
		single unified view of the wealth of resources behind problems and
		solutions accumulated through the years. The purpose of Contest Repository
		is to offer a level of abstraction that allows a single point of
		access to the resources of the different introduced contests.
	</p>
	<h3>Types of resources</h3>
	<p>
		Resources in the Contest Respository are everything that can be browsed,
		viewed, downloaded or uploaded as a result of the interaction of the
		user with the system. The main types of resources are hierarchically
		organized into <a href="${appRoot}/series-format">series</a>
		of contests, <a href="${appRoot}/contest-format">contests</a>
		and <a href="${appRoot}/problem-format">problems</a>
		specific to each contest. Every resource of the main types can in turn
		have additional public and private subresources related to them.
	</p>
	<p>The system provides a web interface to the repository, a REST service and
		more specialized server-side tools for the dedicated admin user to
		help with the management of resources (browsing the available
		infrastructure, creating and uploading/downloading resources, editing
		meta information, deleting unnecessary resources, etc.). There are
		different kinds of users allowed to interact with the system and they
		have varying privileges over the status of the resources.</p>

	<h3>The people behind the project</h3>
